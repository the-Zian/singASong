## Purpose / Research Questions
The advent of readily available, scalable natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning (ML) tools can unlock insights to curiosities in a wealth of text based domains. We believe, with the enduring popularity of music and singing in human cultures, we can begin to answer a host of questions to entertain and enlighten humanity. Given the lyrical content of a song, consider:  

* Predicting the genre  
* Predicting the artist  
* Predicting the recording year
* Predicting whether or not the artist, while writing the song, was under the influence of psychoactive drugs, or love

The list could go on.

## Data
There are several datasets of song lyrics with artist, genre, and other relevant features readily available on the web.

**Potential Sources:**  
* [Kaggle - MetroLyrics](https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics): Over 380,000 lyrics scraped from MetroLyrics with artist, genre, and year attributes  
* [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/): A collection of complimentary audio and song datasets including datasets of cleaned and pre-processed [lyrics](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/musixmatch) and [genre](http://www.tagtraum.com/msd_genre_datasets.html)

## Methods
We plan to employ a variety of supervised ML techniques including, but not limited to:  

* Logistic regression
* Support vector machines (SVM)
* Neural networks
